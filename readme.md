This repository hosts the source code for the concept of a web browser like application.

It is not a real web browser.

It uses [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) as the core, alongside some of my ugly JavaScript code that mimics the functionality of a real web browser.

# Installation

1. Download [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) (the normal version)
2. Extract NW.js zip (for example `C:\nurkibrowser`)
3. Clone `oxou/concept-nurki-browser` and move its contents to `C;\nurkibrowser`
4. Run `nw.exe`
